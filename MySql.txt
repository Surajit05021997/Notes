-- Database : Place where we store data
-- Database Management System(DBMS) : Software used to manage our database
-- Relational Database : Database where we store data in the form of tables and these forms may or may not be related to each other.
-- Structured Query Language(SQl) : Language used to manage the database

-- Data type : Numeric Type - INT, FLOAT, DOUBLE
			   String Type - CHAR, VARCHAR, TEXT
			   Date and Time - DATE, TIME, DATETIME
			   
-- CHAR VS VARCHAR
	The short answer is: VARCHAR is variable length, while CHAR is fixed length.
	
	CHAR is a fixed length string data type, so any remaining space in the field is padded with blanks.
	CHAR takes up 1 byte per character. So, a CHAR(100) field (or variable) takes up 100 bytes on disk, regardless of the string it holds.

	VARCHAR is a variable length string data type, so it holds only the characters you assign to it.
	VARCHAR takes up 1 byte per character, + 2 bytes to hold length information.
	For example, if you set a VARCHAR(100) data type = ‘Jen’, then it would take up 3 bytes (for J, E, and N) plus 2 bytes, or 5 bytes in all.

-- REGEXP is used to match pattern.
	Ex : SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE CITY REGEXP "[aeiou]$";
		selects the distinct city name ending with a,e,i,o or u.

-- The RIGHT() function extracts a number of characters from a string (starting from right).
	Ex : SELECT NAME FROM STUDENTS WHERE MARKS>75 ORDER BY RIGHT(NAME,3),ID;
		Here we are selecting the names of students having marks > 75 sorted by the last three charecter of their name and secondary sort by id if
		last three characters are same.
