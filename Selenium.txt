 -- Selenium is automation testing tool for web application.

-- Selenium Web Driver API allows the test scripts to communicate directly with the web browser without the need of any server 
   which was required for selenium RC(Previous version of Selenium).

-- Basic steps : 
	- First we need to add required jar files externally or adding dependencies in pom.xml file.
	- Now we need to set the property and let java know that what driver we are using and its path using 
		System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver","//path");
	- Now we need driver instance : WebDriver driver = new ChromeDriver(); This statement would open up the chrome browser.
	- Now we can use this driver instance to do lot of things.
	
-- driver.navigate.to("url"); or driver.get("url"); Open that url
   driver.navigate.forward(); 
   driver.navigate.back(); 
   driver.navigate.refresh();
   
-- WebElements are the different elements in a  web page such as text box, radio button, drop-down, etc.
   
-- WebElement element = driver.findElement(By.id("..."));
                                          (By.className("..."));
										  (By.linkText("..."));
										  (By.partialLinkText("..."));
										  (By.cssSelector("..."));
										  (By.xpath("..."));
									
-- element.click();  element.sendKeys("data to send to text box");

-- Data Driven Testing : Its a testing framework where data is stored externally in xls,xml format.
                         We put these data to our test script to test the web application and then compare the expected o/p with the actual o/p.
