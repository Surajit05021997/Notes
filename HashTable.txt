Hash Table
----------
-- It implements the Map interface.
-- It Stores data in key value pair form.
-- It takes the key and pass it through the hash function. This generates a hash code.
   But this hash code is very big number so we reduce the range by applying some formula and we finnaly get the index.
   Now we store the key value pair in this index.
-- Some time index generated is same then we apply linked list to store the key value pair.
