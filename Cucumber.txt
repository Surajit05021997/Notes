Test Driven Development (TDD)
-----------------------------
-- Its an iterative development process.
-- We write the test cases first even before writing the application code.
-- So all the test cases will fail at first first.
-- Next iteration application code is written and the test cases are run.
-- According to the failed test cases we add code to our application code.
-- We follow this untill all the test cases passes.

Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
----------------------------------
-- Its like TDD but here test are written in plain english type grammer.
-- Test are explained as behaviour of application.
-- It bridges the gap between business and technical language.

Cucumber
--------
-- Its a testing framework or automation testing tool which supports BDD.
-- We write the test in simple english type language called Gherkin.
-- We write out test in feature file.
-- Cucumber is written in ruby.

Feature File
------------
-- First we write the feature file whose extention is .feature
-- One feature file will contain one feature.
-- One feature file may contain more than one scenario. These scenario are called steps.
-- 

Steps to run test
-----------------
-- Run the feature file. It will provide the step definetion templetes.
-- Create step definetion class with these step definetion and write the testing code inside these step definetion.
-- Create runner class and run as jUnit.
   @RunWith(Cumcumber.class)
   @CucumberOptions(features="feature folder name", glue="step definetion package name", plugin={"pretty"})
   public class runner {}


-- plugin={"pretty"}   used to generate report
