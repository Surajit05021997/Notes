- Version Control System(VCS) :
	Version Control System(VCS) is a system which is used to keep records of all the changes that are being done on a file or set of files
	so that the previous versions can be recalled and used later.
	
- Types of VCS :
	- Local VCS : Different versions are stored in database inside local machine. Con - Developer can not collaborate
	- Centralized VCS : Different versions are stored inside a server so that different developers can collaborate with each other. 
	 					Con -   If the server is down for sometime, then no one can collaborate or save version on server during that time.
								No backup, If files are corrupted in server then all files are lost.
	- Distributed VCS : Here also the versions are stored in server but here the client doesn't check out the latest snapshots file
						rather they fully mirror the whole repository in their system. So if server dies any of the client repository can be copiwd
						back to the server.
						
- Git : It is a distributed VCS. Git is installed and maintained on your local system (rather than in the cloud) 
		and gives you a self-contained record of your ongoing programming versions. 
		It can be used completely exclusive of any cloud-hosting service — you don’t even need internet access
- Github : It is a cloud hosting website where we can store our git repository.

- File Stages : 
	Modified : Files that are changed or modified but not yet staged or comitted 
	Staged : Modified files are marked for next commit. Before commit, modified files should be staged.
	Commited : Files that are stored safely into the git repository.
	
- Three main section of git project : 
	Working Tree or Directory : Directory where we pull or clone the project and modify the files.
	Staging Area : It is bacically a file inside git directory which contains the information about the files for next commit.
	Git Directory : Directory which contains the metadata and the main project. Whenever we clone a project, files are being fetched from git directory.
	
- Git Workflow : 
	1. You modify files in your working tree.
	2. You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds
		only those changes to the staging area.	
	3. You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot
		permanently to your Git directory.
		
- If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, it’s considered committed. 
  If it has been modified and was added to the staging area, it is staged. 
  And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified.
  
- Creating a git repository : 
	Command : git init
	If we have a directory andd we want to make it a git repository, we have go to that directory with cmd and type command git init
	It will make it a git repository and add the .git folder that contains all the metadata.
	
- git clone : make a copy of the git repository into the local

- Inside working directory, files can be either in tracked or untracked state.
	- Tracked files are unmodified, modified or staged files basically files that git knows.
	- Untracked files are everything else — any files in your working directory that were not in your last
		snapshot and are not in your staging area.
		
- git status : command to check the state or status of files. It also shows the branch.

- git add filename : command to change the untracked files to tracked file and to staged state making the files ready for commit
					 also changes the modified files to staged state making it ready for commit.
- git add . : to change all the untracked and modified files to staged state making the files ready for commit.
