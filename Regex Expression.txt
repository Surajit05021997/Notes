- We write regex expression inside //g
	- Here g is global flag

- Flags : It changes how the expression is interpreted.
	- g (Global Search) : Retain the index of the last match, allowing subsequent searches to start from the end of the previous match
	      RegExr only searches for a single match when the global flag is disabled to avoid infinite match errors
	- i (Ignore Case) : Makes the whole expression case-insensitive. For example, /aBc/i would match AbC
	- m (Multiline) : When the multiline flag is enabled, beginning and end anchors (^ and $) will match the start and end of a line, instead of the start and end of the whole string.
	
- we can directly write literal to search it.
	Ex : /was/g 
	
- MetaCharacters (Need to be escaped):
	.[{()\^$|?*+
	- . : matches everything except line break

- Now if we want to search . we have to escape it. We escape it using \
  If use /\./g then it is going to search for .
  
- .       - Any Character Except New Line
  \d      - Digit (0-9)
  \D      - Not a Digit (0-9)
  \w      - Word Character (a-z, A-Z, 0-9, _)
  \W      - Not a Word Character
  \s      - Whitespace (space, tab, newline)
  \S      - Not Whitespace (not space, tab, newline)

  \b      - Word Boundary
  \B      - Not a Word Boundary
  ^       - Beginning of a String
  $       - End of a String

  []      - Matches Characters in brackets (called character class or character set)
  [^ ]    - Matches Characters NOT in brackets
  |       - Either Or
  ( )     - Group

  Quantifiers:
  *       - 0 or More
  +       - 1 or More
  ?       - 0 or One
  {3}     - Exact Number
  {3,4}   - Range of Numbers (Minimum, Maximum)

- Group and Quantifier Demo
	aaoneoneoneoneaa
	aaoneaa
	aaaa
	
	aa(one)*aa : all three will match
	aa(one)+aa : first two will match
	aa(one)?aa : last two will match
