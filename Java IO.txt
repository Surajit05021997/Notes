- Java IO : Introduced in Java 1(1996)
  Java NIO(Non Blocking IO) : Introduced in Java 4(2002)
  Java NIO 2 : Introduced in Java 7(2011)
  
- Java IO : read and write information in bytes or char

- Java IO API is organized in four base classes :
	Reader and writter for character
	Inputstream and Outputstream for raw bytes

- Java IO has utility class 
	File (Introduced in Java IO)
	Path (Interface introduced in Java NIO 2)
	
- Reader class : read character from file
  Writter class : write character into file
  Inuptstream class :read raw bytes from binary file
  Outputstream class : write raw bytes into binary file
  
- File and Path are the model of file or directory on disk.
	File :
		Creating file object : File file = new File("path_of_file.txt");  --path can be relative or absolute path
		                                                                  --file constructor takes a string which represent a file or directory.
		Creating a file object does not create anything on disk.
		File object can represent a file or directory.
	Path :
		-check for file or directory
		-create/touch/delete
		-get name, path, etc.  
		Above three point are also there in File class
		-get the attribute of file such as security attriute
		-methods to check for directory events
